Have you found it difficult to build new habits? Habit-Maker uses rewards and encouragements to help get over initial willpower required to form new habits.

## Features

### Rewards

Habit-Maker game-ifies making habits by giving you rewards each time you check a habit. It shows the following progress metrics:

- Streaks - The # of days you've completed your habit in a row.
- Points - points for checking habits, with multipliers for continuing your streak.
- % progress to your [66-day-ingrained habit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2009/aug/how-long-does-it-take-form-habit).

### Encouragements

Studies have found that encouragements are [vital](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change) to building new habits. Habit-Maker takes advantage of this by allowing you to create your own **custom encouragements.**

Before creating a habit, take a few minutes and think about _why_ you want to build this habit. What benefits will it bring you, and how your life will improve by doing it?

A good encouragement should have:

- An initial congratulations for completing the habit.
- A message tailored to you, about the benefits or reasons why you should continue.

Some examples of good encouragements:

| Activity                | Encouragement                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brushing your teeth     | Great job! Your friends will like seeing your whiter teeth, and less coffee stains.                |
| Lifting weights for 10m | Nice job! People will notice your better physique.                                                 |
| Cardio for 10m          | Well done! Studies show you're going to live a lot longer!                                         |
| Working out for 10m     | Excellent! You'll have more energy, and feel healthier by continuing!                              |
| Meditating for 10m      | Nice! You're on your way to bettering the lives of those around you, by developing your awareness. |

### Completing a habit

Once a habit has been formed, its relatively easy to continue doing it, almost as if it were on auto-pilot. Research shows that ~40% of our daily activities are habits that don't require much (if any) willpower once they've been formed.
